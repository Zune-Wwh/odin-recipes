        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This strawberry pie is my favorite pie, and it's very easy to make. I got the recipe many years ago in North Jersey from the Sussex County Strawberry Farm.</p>    
       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>1 quart fresh strawberries, hulled</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Arrange 1/2 of strawberries in baked pastry shell. Place remaining strawberries in a medium saucepan.</li>
            <li>Add sugar to the strawberries in the saucepan; place over medium heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Whisk cornstarch and water together in a small bowl. Gradually stir cornstarch mixture into boiling strawberry mixture. Reduce heat and simmer mixture until thickened, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
            <li>Pour cooked strawberry mixture over berries in pastry shell. Refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Before serving, whip cream in a medium bowl until soft peaks form. Serve each slice of pie with a dollop of whipped cream.</li>

        </ol>
